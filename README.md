# math-fixed
Provides an include with complex maths for fixed values.
This was developped for Admin Mod (Half-Life server tool) to work with fixed values (0.000) because the used language Small/Pawn just provides basic arithmetics. So, I neeeded to build the complex arithmetics using the basic ones.
Maybe it's useful for somebody.
